Simulation code and data analysis routines for the following paper:

> Kauhanen, H., Gopal, D., Galla, T. & Berm√∫dez-Otero, R. (2018) "Geospatial distributions reflect rates of evolution of features of language" https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09637


## Contents

* `cpp`: Code (C++) for simulating the model either on a lattice or an arbitrary graph.
* `pkg`: R packages the data analysis code depends on
* `R`: Code (R) for data analysis
* `Rsession`: R session for data analysis
* `OLD`: Old stuff. Will be deleted (or archived) eventually, once all the important bits have been incorporated into the new directory structure.
